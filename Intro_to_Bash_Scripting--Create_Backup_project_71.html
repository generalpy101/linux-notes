<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Create Backup project</h1><br/><p>Backup Script Project Brief</p><p>Scenario</p><p>Your boss has noticed that you do some very valuable work for the company, and, to</p><p>ensure it doesn&#39;t get lost, they have suggested that you create a script that you can</p><p>use to easily backup all the files in your home directory.</p><p>Your boss also thinks that this script will be very useful for others in the office, and</p><p>wants you to make sure the script is professionally formatted before sharing it with</p><p>your colleagues.</p><p>Your Task</p><p>Step 1: Create a bash script called backup_script in your ~/bash_course/ directory.</p><p>This script should backup all the files in your home directory and save them all in a</p><p>.tar archive . Guidance is provided below on how to do this.</p><p>When writing your script, remember to add all the core components of your script:</p><p>1. The “Shebang” line</p><p>2. Commands ( see the &quot;extra guidance&quot; section below )</p><p>3. An exit statement with an appropriate exit code.</p><p>As well as the 5 pieces of professional information:</p><p>1. Author</p><p>2. Date Created</p><p>3. Last Modified</p><p>4. Description</p><p>5. Usage</p><p>Step 2: Give the script the correct permissions.</p><p>Because the script will be shared with others in your organisation, your script should</p><p>have the following permissions:</p><p>● The file owner (i.e you) should have read, write, and execute permissions.</p><p>● Everyone in the file’s group (i.e. your colleagues) should have read and</p><p>execute permissions. For security purposes, they should not have write</p><p>permissions.</p><p>● Everyone else in the organisation should only have read permissions.</p><p>Use permissions-calculator.org/ to figure out the correct octal code to use with the</p><p>chmod command to achieve this.</p><p>Step 3: Run your script multiple times to check that it&#39;s working.</p><p>You should see it creating multiple backups for you in your ~/bash_course folder.</p><p>Extra Guidance</p><p>To build this script, you are going to use the tar command.</p><p>If the tar command is new to you, don&#39;t worry! All you need to know is that the tar</p><p>command is used to create .tar archives, which are basically .zip files, but more</p><p>“Linuxy”.</p><p>Right now, we just want you to use the tar command to practice building</p><p>professional scripts.</p><p>Your script will use the below command (feel free to copy and paste it):</p><p><div class="codebox"><pre><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">tar</span> -cvf ~<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">/</span>bash_course<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">/</span>my_backup_<span style="color:#3ad900;font-weight:400">&quot;$(date +%d-%m-%Y_%H-%M-%S)&quot;</span>.tar ~<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">/</span>* 2&gt;<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">/</span>dev<span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">/</span>null</pre></div></p><p>This command takes the contents of your home directory, compresses it into a .tar</p><p>archive, and saves that archive into the ~/bash_course folder.</p><p>The command also names the backup according to the current date and time. For</p><p>example, a backup made on the 12th July 2020 at 12:00:00 (midday) would be</p><p>saved as my_backup_12-07-2020_12-00-00.tar</p><p></p><p></p><p><div class="codebox"><pre><span style="color:#0088ff;font-weight:400">#!/bin/bash</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#0088ff;font-weight:400">#Author : Prakash</span><br /><span style="color:#0088ff;font-weight:400">#Creation On : 01/01/2022</span><br /><span style="color:#0088ff;font-weight:400">#Last Modified : 01/01/2022</span><br /><br /><span style="color:#0088ff;font-weight:400">#Description</span><br /><span style="color:#0088ff;font-weight:400">#Creates backup of home directory and puts it into ~/bash_course/ directory.
