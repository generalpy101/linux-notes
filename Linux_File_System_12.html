<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Linux File System</h1><br/><p>A file system controls how data is stored and retrieved. </p><p></p><p>All data stored in a disk is just a large chunk of 1s and 0s. We don&#39;t know where something inside a file begins or ends, we cannot determine what data is what.</p><p></p><p>A file is structured group of data. The structure and the logic rules used to manage files and names is known as a file structure.</p><p></p><p>File structure basically determines how to store files and how to perform common operations like read, delete, copy etc.</p><p></p><p>In Linux everything is a file, that includes directories(directories are special type of files) , processed and  hardware devices(disks,external USBs etc.).</p><p></p><p>Linux follows an hierarchial file system which is like a reverse tree.</p><p></p><p><img src="images/12-1.png" alt="images/12-1.png" /></p><p></p><p><img src="images/12-2.png" alt="images/12-2.png" /></p><p></p><p>Each major directory under /(root) has a specific function :</p><p></p><p><strong>/bin</strong> : Contains binaries or user executable files available to all users like ls,cp etc.</p><p></p><p><strong>/sbin</strong> : Contains binaries that only super user can execute(system admin uses) eg ifconfig.</p><p></p><p><strong>/boot</strong> : Contains files required to start your system.</p><p></p><p><strong>/home</strong> : This is where all files of the users are stored. There can be a subdirectory with name of user if that user has its own home directory.</p><p></p><p><strong>/root</strong> : Home directory of root user.</p><p></p><p><strong>/dev</strong> : Contains device files mainly generated during boot time.</p><p></p><p><strong>/etc</strong> : Contains most of the system wide configuration files.   </p><p></p><p><strong>/tmp</strong> : Stores temporary files used by different applications. Files stored here can be deleted anytime without any prior notice.</p><p></p><p><strong>/proc</strong> : It is a virtual directory. It contains info about computer&#39;s hardware like RAM,CPU or Kernel. The files here are generate during booting or on the fly when something changes on the system.</p><p></p><p><strong>/run</strong> : Relatively new directory. It is a temporary file system which runs on RAM.</p><p></p><p><strong>/sys</strong> :  Contains data about system, hardware and other stuff, not accessed directly.</p><p></p><p><strong>/srv</strong> : Contains info about server.</p><p></p><p>/lib : Contains shared library files used by many applications.</p><p></p><p><strong>/media</strong> : Used for external devices, mounted automatically nowadays.</p><p></p><p><strong>/usr</strong> : Earlier it was used as user&#39;s root directory now in some distributions it contains binaries instead of /bin like in CentOS.</p><p></p><p><strong>/mnt</strong> : This is like /media but is not used that much nowadays.</p><p></p><p>Linux file system even treats partitions as a file. </p><p>External USB storage devices are treated as a different file system in linux so to access files from the usb we have to mount the drive to the file system. Nowadays mounting is done automatically.</p><p></p><p><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-file-hierarchy-structure/#:~:text=The%20Linux%20File%20Hierarchy%20Structure,in%20Unix%2Dlike%20operating%20systems.&text=In%20the%20FHS%2C%20all%20files,different%20physical%20or%20virtual%20devices.">GFG on linux file system</a></p></div>
