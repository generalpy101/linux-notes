<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Chaining commands</h1><br/><p>Command list is when we put one or more commands on a given line.</p><p></p><p>List operators are the control operators which are enable us to create command lists with different behaviours.</p><p></p><p>There are 4 list operators :</p><p></p><p><strong>&amp;</strong> allows us to send command before it to background and create a job from it. It is generally used with time consuming commands. Execution is non sequential.</p><p></p><p><img src="images/124-1.png" alt="images/124-1.png" /></p><p></p><p><strong>;</strong> is used to execute commands sequentially. This command is very useful when we want to execute many commands on single line saving space. </p><p></p><p><div class="codebox"><pre>command1 ; command2 ; ....</pre></div></p><p>Command after ; waits for 1st command to execute hence execution is sequential.</p><p><img src="images/124-2.png" alt="images/124-2.png" /></p><p></p><p><strong>&amp;&amp;</strong> is used to sequentially execute commands according to return code of previously executed commands.</p><p><div class="codebox"><pre>command1 &amp;&amp; command2...</pre></div></p><p>Command 2 will only execute if command1 if executed successfully with 0 exit code.</p><p><img src="images/124-3.png" alt="images/124-3.png" /></p><p></p><p><strong>||</strong> is used to sequentially execute commands according return code of previous command. Second command will only execute if first command fails. Used to create backup command.</p><p><div class="codebox"><pre>command1 || command2...</pre></div></p><p><img src="images/124-4.png" alt="images/124-4.png" /></p></div>
