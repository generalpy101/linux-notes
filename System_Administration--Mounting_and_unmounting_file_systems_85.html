<div class='page'><h1 class='title'>Mounting and unmounting file systems</h1><br/><p>Linux file system is like an inverted tree with root as base and is hierarchial.</p><p></p><p>To access a file system that is on a different partition or disk then we have to mount that file system or logically attached it to an existing directory known as mount point.</p><p></p><p>To mount a file system we can use mount command. Without any arguments mount will just display all present attached file system.</p><p></p><p><img src="images/85-1.png" alt="images/85-1.png" /></p><p></p><p>There are many file systems listed because there are also some virtual file system available in linux. </p><p></p><p>To list a file system of particular time, use -t flag followed by file system type.</p><p></p><p><img src="images/85-2.png" alt="images/85-2.png" /></p><p>ext4 is for ext4 file system which is available in latest linux systems. vfat is for fat32 file system. -l stands for list.</p><p></p><p>An external file system is automatically mounted inside /media/username/diskname in modern systems.</p><p></p><p>todo usb</p><p></p><p>In linux every device is logically represented as a char device file stored in /dev directory.</p><p></p><p>To find name of char device use :</p><p></p><p>fdisk -l  or dmesg or lsblk.</p><p></p><p>To mount a device by our own with our own options or with external options, we can use mount command.</p><p></p><p><div class="codebox"><pre><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">mount</span> path_of_device_in_dev destination_directory.</pre></div></p><p></p><p>We can mount same device at different places.</p><p></p><p>We can use -t option with mount to define file system type if not identified.</p><p></p><p>To unmount a device from a location, use umount and mounting path. We have to ensure that file system is not busy(files are not open). We can use -l or --lazy option to unmount lazily which is unmount when work is done.</p><p></p><p>To specify extra options during mounting, use -o with options.</p><p></p><p>To mount a iso, use loop option</p><p></p><p><div class="codebox"><pre><span style="color:#ff9d00;font-weight:700">mount</span> path_to_iso destination_point -o loop</pre></div></p><p></p><p>We can manage disks and partitions using fdisk but it is hard for beginners so we can use gparted which is a gui tool to manage partitions.</p></div>
