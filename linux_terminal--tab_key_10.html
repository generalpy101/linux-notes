It is used to autocomplete command or paths  which can come in handy when writing very long commands.</p><p></p><p>To autocomplete a command or path , just write its name and then press tab. This initiates a search in current directory along with whole system to find a suitable match for command. If a single match is found, command is automatically completed. If multiple matches are found, command does nothing, you have to press tab one more time and all suitable matches will be listed.</p><p></p><p>If there is a command which tab must match but is  not matching, then there is some typo in the command.</p><p></p><p>Use tab key while writing long commands or paths, this removes chances of errors.</p></div>
